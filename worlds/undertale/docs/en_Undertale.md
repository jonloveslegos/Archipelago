# Undertale

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What is considered a location check in Undertale?

Location checks in Undertale are all the spots in the game where you can get an item. Exceptions are Dog Residue, 
the Nicecream bought in Hotland, and anything you cannot get on your chosen route.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item in Undertale, it will go into their inventory if they have space, otherwise it will 
wait until they do have space.

## What is the victory condition?

Victory is achieved when the player completes their chosen route. If they chose `all_routes` then they need to complete 
every major route in the game, those being `Pacifist`, `Neutral`, and `Genocide`.

## What is different from the vanilla game?

There are some major differences between vanilla and the randomizer. 

There are now doors to every major area in the underground located in the flower room (the first room of the game.)
These doors lead to Ruins, Snowdin, Waterfall, Hotland, and New Home from left to right. 
Each door needs their respective key from the pool to enter, with the exception of New Home, which is always unlocked. 

You start with the key of your choice, and the rest of the keys will be in the item pool to be found by players.

**Genocide** works a little differently in terms of the requirements. 

In order to win with the genocide route, you only need to beat Sans to win. 
If you choose to fight other major bosses, you will still need to grind out the area before fighting them like normal.

**Pacifist** remains mostly the same.

In the Pacifist run, you are not required to go to the Ruins to spare Toriel. The only necessary spares are Papyrus, 
Undyne, and Mettaton EX. Just as it is in the vanilla game, you cannot kill anyone. You are also required to complete 
the date/hangout with Papyrus, Undyne, and Alphys, in that order, before entering the True Lab. A Neutral run is no 
longer a requirement.

Additionally, custom items are required to hang out with Papyrus, Undyne, and to enter the True Lab. 
The respective items for each interaction are `Complete Skeleton`, `Fish`, and `DT Extractor`.

There are also a few **universal** changes, which are always true.

The Riverperson will only take you to locations you have seen them at, meaning they will only take you to
Waterfall if you have seen them at Waterfall at least once.

If you press `W` while in the savepoint menu, you will teleport back to the flower room, 
for quick access to the other areas. (Some rooms will not allow you to warp out for the possibility of softlocking your 
save)
